            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>Our goals were to get insights in the <i>Effectiveness, Efficiency, Engagement, Error Tolerance</i> and <i>Easiness to learn</i> of our website. By using these 5 anchor points, we could determine where some adjustments were needed. Either visually, or technically, this (and the only) round of usability testing served to improve the site overall.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>The test&rsquo;s <strong>participants</strong> (number, match with target audience, etc.)
                <li>The test&rsquo;s <strong>setting</strong> (which material is used, is it done remotely, on campus, at home, etc.)
                <li>The test&rsquo;s <strong>protocol</strong> (what instructions are given, how it is recorded, etc.)
              </ul>
            </li>
