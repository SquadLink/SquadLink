            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>Our goals were to get insights in the <i>Effectiveness, Efficiency, Engagement, Error Tolerance</i> and <i>Easiness to learn</i> of our website. By using these 5 anchor points, we could determine where some adjustments were needed. Either visually, or technically, this (and the only) round of usability testing served to improve the site overall.</p>
             <ul>   
                <li><h4>Participants</h4>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Stephen Raas</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Remik Lis</strong></li>

                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li><h4>Test Setting</h4>
                  <p>All tests were conducted remotely in the participants’ natural environments using their own devices. A live version of the SquadLink website and scenario-based instructions were provided.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>Test Protocol</h4>
                    <p>Participants received a role-specific scenario and were instructed to speak their thoughts aloud while navigating. Sessions were recorded for screen and audio, followed by a short debrief interview. Due to a technical error, one video has no screen recording, but does contain the recorded audio.</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Most users completed their goals, with some needing extra time for specific info.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Navigation is mostly intuitive, though some content needs better placement.</li>
                <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Design and tone are appealing; additional interaction options would help.</li>
                <li><strong>Error Tolerance:</strong> Minor issues now improved with better feedback for forms.</li>

                  <li><h4><strong>Our Actions:</strong></h4>
                    <p>For our very first campaign week, we started with three introduction posts to increase our brand awareness and give our audience a clear vision of who we are as a brand and what we offer. All three posts are carousel posts in the colours of our brand. We also chose to add music. We posted consecutively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Each of these days we posted at 19:00 in the evening, based on our problem interviews. The first carousel talked about who we are as a brand. The second provided tips for better team chemistry, which is the core of our brand. The final carousel gave a clear step by step plan on how to become a part of SquadLink. Each post ended with one clear call to action.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately we were not seen as a professional account yet in this first week on Instagram, so we do not have the viewer analytics for this week. For TikTok we had expected these posts to get around 100 views each as our account was completely new. To our surprise they did very well with 500-1100 views each, causing us to already reach our objective for TikTok. The engagement was what we had anticipated and still pretty low. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li><h4><strong>What we learned:</strong></h4>
                    <p>The short and clear carousels posts with music did very well on TikTok as an introduction to our brand. Unfortunately, we cannot be sure for Instagram, though based on engagement it did well. We learned that some of our objectives were reached much faster than we expected when setting up the campaign, meaning that for our future planning we can make new, higher objectives.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><h4><strong>Our Actions:</strong></h4>
                    <p>In the second week we decided to change our content as our introduction phase was over. We focused on our target audience and started posting memes based on online research of our target audience. We decided on 2 posts per week, one regular meme on Thursday and a meme in reel format on Saturday to variate and test our content types. As our last posts with music did well, we used this again. As a change we added a call to action in our captions which we had not done in the previous week. We also tried out two different times to test if this made a difference. On Thursday at 10:00 and on Saturday at 19:00 still. </p>

                    <p>While we could not compare the Instagram analytics to week 1, our views and engagement were better than expected, and also already reached our objective. Our views on TikTok were lower than the carousel posts but accurate to our expectations before starting the campaign.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><h4><strong>What we learned:</strong></h4>
                    <p>The reel meme did better on both platforms than the regular meme. It also confirmed our earlier interview-based decision of posting at 19:00. So far, the reels seem to work great with our audience. Whether the success was mostly impacted by the day, time or type of content is still unclear. To be sure about the success of these factors, we followed a similar posting pattern the third week, with a different meme and reel, and by posting at different times. Lastly, for the regular meme we had purposely picked a song popular among Genz ‘Not like us’ by Kendrick. However, did not seem to have any positive effect.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><h4><strong>Our Actions:</strong></h4>
                <p>We posted another regular meme on Thursday at 19:00 and a reel on Saturday testing a different time,15:30. For the second half of our campaign we also wanted to test whether making use of hashtags and stories had any significant influence on our views and engagement. Both posts had multiple hashtags in the caption, and the post on Thursday was accompanied by a story to test the difference on this post in comparison to the other without story.</p>

                <p>The results were very surprising. The regular meme did great on TikTok with 796 views, but not on Instagram with just 25. On the other hand, the reel did extremely well on Instagram with our highest number of 5073 views, while it did not do very good on TikTok.  </p>
              </li>
              <li><h4><strong>What we learned:</strong></h4>
                <p>So far, the reels have been doing very well on Instagram and average on TikTok, while the regular memes differ a lot with each post and platform which makes the success rate more irregular and not reliable. For this reason, we decided to focus on only reels for the final promotion week. We believe that with the sudden increase in views, the use of hashtags might have made a significantly positive influence.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><h4><strong>Our Actions:</strong></h4>
                <p>In our final week we made sure to really look at what has worked and not worked so far in the first 3 weeks of our promotional campaign. Since the reels have repeatedly proven to be a success, we changed our posts to a reel on both days with the same hashtags. From the analytics we can say that 19:00 works the best on average, so both posts are now posted at this time. We also posted a story for each reel. </p>

                <p>The reels have proven to continuously do well on both platforms, specifically on Instagram, as well as our posting time and days. Since we started using hashtags in the third week our posts have gotten a lot more views and engagement. Posting stories on the same days did not make any significant difference. </p>

                <p>Despite our views and engagement, we did not manage to achieve a big following. Overall, far better result that first expected.</p>
              <li><h4><strong>What we would do differently:</strong></h4>
                <p>Looking back at our entire campaign we realized some things that we have not tested out yet and could cause us to have missed opportunities. For one, we would switch up the posting days more. While we tried out many different things, we only posted on different days in our first week, and afterwards only on Thursday and Saturday. We would try out different variations of days to be sure that our chosen posting schedule truly works best for our target audience. Secondly, we would post more often than twice a week to see if this increases our brand awareness and overall engagement. The last thing we would do different is our stories. We only posted stories on the days of our actual posts. If we did it again, we would post stories on different days to cause repeated exposure.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          <h2 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h2>
            <p>If we were to extend our campaign for another 8 weeks, we would make changes based on our findings from our previous campaign. First, we would start by making new objectives as we reached the last ones in the span of 1 week. In this situation we would start our new campaign on the 21st of April and end on the 15th of June. </p>
            <ul>
              <h2>Reach objectives</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Reach 8.000 people on Instagram by the 15th of June 2024 </li>
                <li>Reach 6.000 people on TikTok by the 15th of June 2024 </li>
              </ul>
              <p>We believe this is realistic based on the fact that we reached 4551 separate accounts on Instagram and 3484 on TikTok within 4 weeks, and because we now have better insights on what works. </p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <h2>Affect objectives</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>We want our target audience to feel part of a community by reaching 50 followers on Instagram and 15 on TikTok by the 15th of June 2024</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We believe the success of whether our audience feels part of our community is measurable by actually following our brand and in that way repeatedly engaging with us.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <h2>Response objectives</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>We want 300 likes on Instagram by the 15th of June 2024</li>
                <li>We want 100 likes on TikTok by the 15th of June 2024</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We think these are realistic based on our previous analytics.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <h2>The Campaign</h2>
                <p>As mentioned in what we would do differently, there are a few things we would alter when doing a new 8-week promotional campaign. We would post more frequently to increase brand awareness and viewer engagement. Instead of 2 times per week we would do 3 posts per week consistently. We will continue to post on Thursday and Saturday since we found that both of these days work great with our audience. The added third post will vary between different days for the first 4 weeks to get a clear and reliable view on what combinations will create the best results. Based on this, we will decide on fixed posting days for the final 4 weeks. We will continue to post mainly reels as this proved to do very well among our target audience. However, we would alternate the reels between 2 memes and 1 serious brand content post to keep our viewers informed on any updates and information. For example, a detailed update about our new premium option for individual performance tracking. The posting time of 19:00 will remain the same for each day as this time proved to work great in our previous campaign, based on the analytics. While the stories did not have a large impact, we had not tried to post stories on different days than our actual posts. This is why we will do this for the first 4 weeks of the new campaign, in order to repeatedly expose our followers to our brand throughout the week and test the impact. These stories will be scheduled on each workday, Monday to Friday, that we do not already post. With all our new insights, we believe that this campaign will be successful and that we can reach all our new objectives.</p>
            </ul>
